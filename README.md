# Getting Started with SALT Loan Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this app, you will need to create a `.env` file and add the following keys:

`REACT_APP_LOGO_URL='https://saltlending.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/logo.svg'`
`REACT_APP_CRYPTO_COMPARE_API_KEY=<insert your own Crypto Compare API Key here>`

You can visit [Crypto Compare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/cryptopian/api-keys) to get your free API Key.

# Notes

There are multiple things I would have liked to address in this project, had there been more time to complete this to my satisfaction. 
This includes:
- Improving styles to better match the design mocks.
- Test coverage for all components, calculation functions, and user experience.
- Improved file architecture.
- Improved error handling.
- Small tweaks to the UI to create a more enjoyable user experience.

This project allowed me to work in React with Typescript in a way that I have not been able to yet. I have experience with Typescript in Node.js, but this project provided ample learning and growth opportunities for me. I am extremely grateful to have been able to work on this code challenge, and I hope to be able to work with you all in the future.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
